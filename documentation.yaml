  # NetLogo View2.5D Extension

  The `view2.5d` extension allows you to visualize 2d models on a 3d surface, using height to represent agent properties.

    This command must be called from the Observer context.  (Attempting to call from another context causes an error)
    The Title is a string, which will be used to label the new Window and to call for subsequent updates and modifications.
    Specification of the Reporter uses the NetLogo anonymous procedure syntax, from the Observer perspective.

    Example:

    ```NetLogo
    view2.5d:patch-view "Test"  [ [the-patch] -> [pxcor] of the-patch ]
    ```

    This command must be called from the Observer context.  (Attempting to call from another context causes an error)
    The Title is a string, the label of an existing Patch View Window.
    Effect:  draws the turtles of the model at their current location, on top of the Patch view display

    > NOTE: only has an effect in the "structures" patch view (in the others, the patch value is inclined based on neighbors & gradient)

    > NOTE: for negative patch values, the turtle shapes are drawn below (orbit underneath to see them)

    ```NetLogo
    view2.5d:decorate-patch-view "Test"

    This command must be called from the Observer context.  (Attempting to call from another context causes an error)

    The Title is a string, the label of an existing Patch View Window.
    Effect:  STOPS drawing the turtles of the model at their current location, on top of the Patch view display

    This command must be called from the Observer context.  (Attempting to call from another context causes an error)
    The Title is a string, which will be used to label the new Window and to call for subsequent updates.
    The turtle-set is any selector for turtles.
    Reporter is an anonymous reporter that should take a turtle as input, and report some number from it.

    Example:

    ```
    view2.5d:turtle-view "Test" turtles with [color = red] [ the-turtle -> [energy] of the-turtle]
    ; This would create a new 2.5d window, plotting the ENERGY value of all turtles that are red.
